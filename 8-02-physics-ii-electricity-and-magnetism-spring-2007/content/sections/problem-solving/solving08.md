description: This resource tells to  gain intuition for the behavior of DC circuits
  with both resistors and capacitors or inductors. In this particular problem solving
  you will be working with an RC circuit. You should carefully consider what would
  change if the capacitor were replaced with an inductor and to calculate the time
  dependent currents in such circuits.
